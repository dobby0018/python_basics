#Python uses references to objects. This means that when you create a variable and assign it a value, the variable holds a reference to that object in memory.
x = 42
# The variable x is not a pointer to the value 42; it's a reference to the integer object 42. If you create another variable and assign it to x, it will also reference the same object:



y = x  # Both x and y reference the same integer object 42
# This approach is more memory-safe and helps avoid many common pointer-related issues like memory leaks and pointer arithmetic errors.

# In the context of linked lists or other data structures, you can use variables or attributes that hold references to other objects to create linked structures. For example, in a singly linked list, you use an attribute next to hold a reference to the next node in the list.


class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
# Here, self.next is not a traditional pointer but rather a reference to the next node's instance in the linked list. It points to the memory location of the next node.

# So, while Python doesn't expose explicit pointers as in some other languages, you work with references, which serve a similar purpose in managing memory and data structures.
